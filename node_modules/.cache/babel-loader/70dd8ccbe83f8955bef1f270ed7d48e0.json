Only a few years\n              ago, clicking pictures and making videos with mobile phones was a\n              compromise, with low image quality. However, times have changed\n              since, and phone cameras have gotten better and better. Check out\n              some essential hacks to capture the best images you can get from\n              your phone: 1. Start with a good quality camera This one is a\n              little obvious, but the quality of smartphone cameras is<br />\n              increasing day by day. If you’re using an older handset, there’s a\n              chance you could upgrade to better camera quality. If you’re\n              looking to upgrade to a newer model, be sure to sell your old\n              phone at CASHIFLIX for the best price and seamless & safe pickup.\n              2. Set up the lighting Smartphone camera sensors are much smaller\n              than what you would find in even a compact digital camera. Despite\n              having very bright lenses, smaller sensors give mobile phones a\n              distinct disadvantage in image quality in dim lighting. To get\n              better quality, try to set up your shot such that there’s natural\n              light falling on your subject. Sunlight has all the right<br />\n              frequencies to make any photograph better. It’s always a good idea\n              to open a window as opposed to using your phone’s underpowered and\n              sharp LED flash. For those times when you need to click a picture\n              without much natural light, the next hack may help. 3. Play with\n              your camera’s exposure settings Smartphone camera apps typically\n              offer some level of manual control to the photographer. A simple\n              yet powerful adjustment you can make is the exposure. It can\n              brighten or darken a scene. Using this feature may turn a bland\n              image into an eye-catching shot. Android phones usually display a\n              +/- icon for adjusting adjustment. On an iPhone, look for the sun\n              icon to the right of the focus confirmation box and drag it up and\n              down to brighten or darken an image respectively. 4. Use the rule\n              of thirds You can turn on the gridlines feature in your phone’s\n              camera app. Using the grid lines as a reference can help in\n              keeping the camera straight. They’re also helpful in taking\n              portraits in front of a landmark- keep upright structures<br />\n              perfectly vertical in your photos for more aesthetic appeal. Using\n              photography guidelines such as the “rule of thirds” can make your\n              photos more appealing. It suggests mentally dividing up your image\n              into nine parts using two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.\n              The critical elements in your scene should then be placed along\n              those lines, or at the points where they meet. The theory is that\n              an off-centre composition appears more aesthetic to the viewer and\n              looks more natural than a picture where the subject is placed\n              right in the centre of the photo. 5. Set your focus up close Even\n              without any add-ons, your smartphone camera can set the focus\n              pretty close. This feature is one of the things in which small\n              image sensors can work better than the larger ones. You can snap a\n              picture up close while keeping the entire frame in focus. That’s\n              something a big camera can’t do and can get you some stunning and\n              head-turning photographs.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n        </div>\n\n{/* ==============third section start here ===================*/}\n <div className=\"main_hacks_section2\">\n   <h2>How To Hide Apps On Android Devices</h2>\n        <div className=\"blog_hacks_div\">\n          <div className=\"hacks_imges\">\n            <img src={blog22} alt=\"\" />\n            <p>MARCH 19, 2021</p>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"hacks_content\">\n            <p>\n              In today’s digital age, our smartphones have become a constant\n              companion keeping us in continuous contact with the outside world.\n              With the current demand for high-quality smartphone cameras in new\n              mobile phones, smartphones are increasingly becoming our <br />\n              shoot-anything, take- everywhere digital cameras. Only a few years\n              ago, clicking pictures and making videos with mobile phones was a\n              compromise, with low image quality. However, times have changed\n              since, and phone cameras have gotten better and better. Check out\n              some essential hacks to capture the best images you can get from\n              your phone: 1. Start with a good quality camera This one is a\n              little obvious, but the quality of smartphone cameras is<br />\n              increasing day by day. If you’re using an older handset, there’s a\n              chance you could upgrade to better camera quality. If you’re\n              looking to upgrade to a newer model, be sure to sell your old\n              phone at CASHIFLIX for the best price and seamless & safe pickup.\n              2. Set up the lighting Smartphone camera sensors are much smaller\n              than what you would find in even a compact digital camera. Despite\n              having very bright lenses, smaller sensors give mobile phones a\n              distinct disadvantage in image quality in dim lighting. To get\n              better quality, try to set up your shot such that there’s natural\n              light falling on your subject. Sunlight has all the right<br />\n              frequencies to make any photograph better. It’s always a good idea\n              to open a window as opposed to using your phone’s underpowered and\n              sharp LED flash. For those times when you need to click a picture\n              without much natural light, the next hack may help. 3. Play with\n              your camera’s exposure settings Smartphone camera apps typically\n              offer some level of manual control to the photographer. A simple\n              yet powerful adjustment you can make is the exposure. It can\n              brighten or darken a scene. Using this feature may turn a bland\n              image into an eye-catching shot. Android phones usually display a\n              +/- icon for adjusting adjustment. On an iPhone, look for the sun\n              icon to the right of the focus confirmation box and drag it up and\n              down to brighten or darken an image respectively. 4. Use the rule\n              of thirds You can turn on the gridlines feature in your phone’s\n              camera app. Using the grid lines as a reference can help in\n              keeping the camera straight. They’re also helpful in taking\n              portraits in front of a landmark- keep upright structures<br />\n              perfectly vertical in your photos for more aesthetic appeal. Using\n              photography guidelines such as the “rule of thirds” can make your\n              photos more appealing. It suggests mentally dividing up your image\n              into nine parts using two horizontal lines and two vertical lines.\n              The critical elements in your scene should then be placed along\n              those lines, or at the points where they meet.
